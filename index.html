<H1>Trust In God<BR>and Keep Your Powder Dry</H1>
<H2>What's Important?</H2>
Each and every one of us have infinite responsibilities, and only finite capacity.  I am a husband, a therapist, a friend, a brother, a son, a musician, a writer  — So many roles.  Any one role could suck up all my time.  In this moment, I have a choice:  How will I spend my time <em>now</em>. Thus: "What's should I do in this moment?" 
<p>
<H3>Keeping the Powder Dry</H3>
At my most stressed, I panic. I remind myself "I am physically safe.  Breathe."  Calming myself becomes the most important thing to do in this moment.  Seeing things with some perspective.  Whatever I'm feeling, it won't last forever.
Then, the spiral begins.  Beyond this little arc of a few seconds, in which i am no longer panicking, but can make a choice about how I spend my time.  What is important?
<p>
In the novel <em>Shogun</em>, John Blackthorne, <em>Anjin-san</em>, befriends a fellow
pilot, Rodrigues.  They both know the fear of sailing a ship into
uncharted waters, facing unknown dangers, and too often having no
knowledge of how many days, weeks or months will pass before the
lookout will call "Land!  Land Ho!".  Their phrase of comfort and
defiance was "I'm going to trust in God and keep my powder dry". 
Keeping the gunpowder dry was important, because damp gunpowder
won't fire.  And given the piracy and brutality of the era, it was
important to be able to defend your ship.  

<p> 

Living in the
twenty-first century, as a white male in California, a need to
defend myself physically has not arisen in my life, so what modern
equivalent is there to keeping my powder dry?   <p> The most generic
answer to this question I have been able to formulate is not
original.  Borrowed from an ancient western code, it comes down to:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>
		If I am not for myself, who will be for me?  
	</li>
	<li>
		If I am only for myself, what am I?  
	</li>
	<li>
		If not now, when?  
	</li>
</ul>

<p> 
My answer to the question of what's most important is that I need to serve both
myself and others, and do it now.  I think this answer is sufficient abstract 
that it has general applicability.  As a high level answer, it lacks
the concreteness of "Keep your powder dry".  For good or ill, the most concrete
pieces of advice I have for myself — "Breathe" — "Remember, I'm physically safe"
— "This too shall pass", are all most germaine at the moment of panic. After that,
things get more complex. The emphasis on self or other is something to be dynamically
balanced. A good parent will focus his life around his children. I know artists so
absorbed in their work that the world fades. Dreamworker and Unitarian Minister 
Jeremy Taylor argues that in the 
limiting case, a life engaged in one's own creative pursuits also ultimately serves
others as a model, demonstrating the possibilities of the expression of creative energies.

Clearly how we serve ourselves, and how we serve others is going to be age and context
dependant.  As I mentored a kid through his teen years, I told him "Don't get a girl pregnant,
and don't do drugs."  I would have added "Don't join a gang" if he'd been leaning that way.
I considered these the basics of self-care for a teen. Good marks in school, friendship,
fitness I considered secondary and tertiary considerations.

There are lots of different ways of talking about these ideas.

<H3>Trusting In God</H3>

I'm an atheist. I've also had profound spiritual experiences. I
spent twenty years as a meditator, though I don't currently meditate
regularily.  When caught in the throes of spiritual experience, I feel connected
to everything in the universe.  An <em>oceanic</em> experience.  I
feel safe, loved, loving, confident, strong.  I can bring myself to these states
by practicing Kundalini Yoga, by using marijuana, by going without
sleep for several days, and, once in my life, just by stting on a
rock and meditating in the Mojave Desert in Joshua Tree National
Park.  They have also occured during the two Manic Episodes I've had
in my life.

Sometimes the experiences come with words, sometimes with
images, sometimes with a powerful sense of energy flowing in my
body.  

<p>

As a student of science, I know stars are responsible for forming
all the naturally occurring elements heavier than hydrogen and
helium — before stellar nucleosynthesis, only the lightest elements
existed in the universe.  Every atom in my body with an atomic
number greater than two was synthesised in a star that shone billions
of years in the past. I am connected, if not to everything in the universe,
than to quite a bit more than I imagined when my father recited 
<a href="invictus.html">Invictus</a>
<a name="invictus"></a>
to me.

<P>

My brother is a reborn Christian.  I envy him. When adversity comes
his way, he prays — asking God "What do you want me to learn
from this, Lord?".  I haven't found a secular equivalent with as 
much punch. He trusts that there is meaining and purpose in each
moment in life.

<H3>Notes</H3>

Manic Episodes should be avoided if possible. I got there accidentally
via sleep deprivation, and both times I became psychotic.  (Psychosis
is characterized by hallucinations and/or delusions).  My wife can
tell you: it is quite difficult to deal with someone in a psychotic
state.
