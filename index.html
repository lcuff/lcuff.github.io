Each and every one of us have infinite responsibilities, and only finite capacity.  I am a husband, a therapist, a friend, a brother, a son, a musician — So many roles.  Any one role could suck up all my time.  In this moment, I have a choice:  How will I spend my time now.   Thus: "What's important to do now?" 

At my most stressed, I can become almost panicky:  I remind myself "I am physically safe.  Breathe."  Calming myself becomes the most important thing to do in this moment.  Seeing things with some perspective.  Whatever I'm feeling, it won't last forever.

Then, the spiral begins.  Beyond this little arc of a few seconds, in which i am no longer panicking, but can make a choice, How do I want to spend my time?  What is important?

In the novel Shogun, John Blackthorne befriends a fellow pilot, Rodrigues.  They both know the fear of sailing a ship into uncharted waters, facing unknown dangers, and indeed sometimes no knowledge of how many days, weeks or months will pass before the lookout will call "Land!  Land Ho!".  Their phrase of comfort was "I"ll trust in God and keep my powder dry".  Keeping the gunpowder dry was important, because damp gunpowder won't fire.  And given the piracy and brutality of the era, it was important to be able to defend your ship.

Living in the twenty-first century, as a white male in California, a need to defend myself physically has not arisen in my life, so what modern equivalent is there to keeping my powder dry?  

The most generic answer to this question I have been able to formulate is not original.  Borrowed from an ancient western code, it comes down to:

If I am not for myself, who will be for me?

If I am only for myself, what am I?

If not now, when?
