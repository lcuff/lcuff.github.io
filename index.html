My sister Bridget is celebrating her birthday today.  May 26th.  
She is 47 years older than she was 47 years ago.  Yay!  (And then,
she was 12 years older than she was 12 years before that.)

        <p>
To celebrate her years here on earth, I Googled far and wide to 
discover other things that occurred on this auspicious day. Here
is what I found:

        <p>
On this day in 1897 Dracula, authored by Irish novelist Bram Stoker,
is published. Reviewers say "It's a bloody good novel, with real
bite."

        <p>
In 1923, the first 24 Hours of Le Mans race was held. Drivers claim
they have been given the run-around.

        <p>
On this day, in AD 17, Germanicus celebrated his triumph in Rome for
his victories over several German tribes west of the Elbe. As his
chariot rode through the streets of Rome, he fell out of his chariot,
and was about to be trampled by horses.  He was dragged to safety
by a young man from Galilee who later became famous in his own
right.

        <p>
On this day in 1328, William of Ockham and other Franciscans 
flee Avignon, fearing a death sentence from Pope John XXII. In his
hurry, William leaves his razor behind.  Cutting to the chase, 
Ockham's razor becomes more famous that William himself.

        <p>
On this day in 1538 John Calvin is expelled from the city of Geneva.
He said "it was bound to happen, but I chose to leave", thus setting
the stage for his later theories of predestination and the paradox 
of free will. God knows what we're going to do, but .... we still
get to choose.  Confusing. No wonder John Calvin and Calvin and
Hobbes are so intertwined.

        <p>
On this day in 1736, The Battle of Ackia was fought near the present
site of Tupelo, Mississippi.  British and Chicksaw soldiers repelled
a French and Choctaw attack on the then-Chicksaw village of Ackia.
Billy Joe McAllister witnessed this, and threw a dead soldier from
the bridge.

        <p>
On this day in 1967 The Beatles Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band is released.  It is discovered that Paul died in the making
of the album, hence the mourners on the front album cover.

        <p>
It is the Christian Feast Day for Quadratus of Athens, an early
Christian apologist.  He apologizes many times for inventing the
Quadratic Equation, which will later traumatize schoolchildren to
no good end.

        <p>
John Wayne, Stevie Nicks, Sally Ride, Hank Williams Jr and Jack Kevorkian
were all born on May 26th, and diarist Samuel Pepys died.  

        <p>
The philosopher Martin Heidegger died on May 26th, 1976. We all
know that Marty is best known for his contributions to phenomenology,
hermeneutics, and existentialism.  Hermeneutics, as we also know, is
the art of understanding and of making oneself understood. So
says Wikipedia.  I say, anybody who wants to be understood would
not be using words like phenomenology, hermeneutics and existentialism.

        <p>
Most importantly, it is National Paper Airplane Day

As of 2012, Takuo Toda holds the world record for the longest time
in air (27.9 seconds). The distance record (226 feet, 10 inches
or 69.14 meters) was set by Joe Aye, with a plane constructed by
John Collins, in February 2012.

        <p>
I love you Bridget.  I hope this day and every day is filled with joy.

        To do so, solve this riddle: The Right Hand Side starts with 'gm' and rhymes with 'whale'.
        Followed of course by 'dot com'.
